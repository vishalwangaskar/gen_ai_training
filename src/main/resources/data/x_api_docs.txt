X API platform resources
In the API design space, a resource is an entity with associated data, relationships to other resources, and a set of methods that operate on it. For example, a Post is a resource that you can create, delete, or retrieve using a variety of different tools, such as historically searching for them, or retrieving them in real-time.

The X API provides access to create, delete, receive, or adjust a variety of different resources on the platform including the following:
